# This is a configuration notecard based on the key-value data Wizardry and Steamworks reader. 
# Everything following the "#" character is ignored along with blank lines. Values can be set for various 
# parameters in a simple and understandable format with the following syntax: 
#
# key = "value"  
#
# Every time you change this configuration notecard, the script will reset itself and read this notecard.

#this is the key of the corrade bot you want to use
